{"name":"ConversionSVG","tagline":"This is a frontend to the Inkscape command line feature to allow the user to perform batch conversions of SVG files.","body":"# Conversion SVG\r\n\r\nConversionSVG is a frontend wrapper around Inkscape's command line feature. It\r\nprovides users who want to perform batch conversions of their SVG files into\r\nthe other file formats Inkscape can export to.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [Inkscape][inkscape] is installed\r\n- [Java 6][2] is installed\r\n\r\n[Download Conversion SVG][1] and run it.\r\n\r\n### Libraries Used\r\n\r\n[ConversionSVG on SourceForge][0] -- I started with metalkev64's code from SourceForge, but eventually rewrote most of it. Without his contributions, I probably would not have even started this.\r\n\r\n[Flamingo library][flamingo] -- I didn't want to use menu's; ever since I used Office 2007 with the Ribbon I refuse to use menus where I can and use Ribbons instead. So, upon doing some research I came across the flamingo swing component suite.\r\n\r\n[JIDE Common Layer][jide-common] -- I wanted to improve the way I selected files to convert, and thought of the checkbox tree I've seen in Windows. After some searching, I came across the CheckBoxTree the jide library provides. \r\n\r\n[ColorChooser Widget][colorchooser] -- The background color selection in the original app was too slow for me, so I wondered if there was existing code that implemented a color picker. I came across the Color Picker at java.net.\r\n\r\n[fstreem on SourceForge][fstreem] -- I didn't want to spend a lot of time on how to access the file system in a device independent way in Java, so I did some searching on how to do this in Java and came across a SF project which provided some code that happened to work for me.\r\n\r\n[Tango Icons][tango] -- Most of the icons used are from the Tango Desktop Project.\r\n\r\n[GoSquared Flag Icons][gosquared] -- The flags used for language icons are a set created by Go Squared Ltd.\r\n\r\n[0]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/conversionsvg/ \"The original application\"\r\n[1]: https://github.com/erichschroeter/conversionsvg/downloads \"Downloads page\"\r\n[2]: http://java.com/en/download/ \"Java download page\"\r\n[inkscape]: http://inkscape.org/ \"Open source vector graphics editor\"\r\n[flamingo]: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.insubstantial/flamingo/7.0 \"A collection of ribbon components for Swing applications\"\r\n[jide-common]: https://jide-oss.dev.java.net/ \"JIDE Common Layer (Professional Swing Components)\"\r\n[colorchooser]: https://colorchooser.dev.java.net/ \"A Swing widget for selecting colors with single mouse gesture\"\r\n[fstreem]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fstreem/files/ \"SourceForge File System TreeModel\"\r\n[tango]: http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library \"The Tango Desktop Project\"\r\n[gosquared]: http://www.gosquared.com/liquidicity/archives/1493 \"2400 Flag Icon Set\"\r\n","google":"UA-25317287-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
